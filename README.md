# binkey
Binkey, short for binary keyboard is a small macropad that allows you to count using binary!! It uses 4 switches, 4 LED's, and a EC11 rotary encoder

## Why did I build this?

I made this as a part of Pathfinder, a You Ship We Ship for hackclub where you build a game controller with a few constraints.

## Code

The code was fully written in Arduino INO as one of the requirements for pathfinder was that the code must be written in C++. This left me to either use some really obscure and hard framework that took forever to learn, or learn Arduino INO.
